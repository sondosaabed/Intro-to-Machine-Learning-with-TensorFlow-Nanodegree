# Intro-to-Machine-Learning-with-TensorFlow-Nanodegree
Acquired a full scholarship from Google Palestine Launchpad. It is about the mastery of machine learning techniques such as data transformation and algorithms that can find patterns in data and apply machine learning algorithms to tasks of their own design.

## Courses

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning


### 2. Introduction to neural networks
#### Introduction to Neural Networks
In this lesson, Luis will give you solid foundations on deep learning and neural networks. You'll also implement gradient descent and backpropagation in Python right here in the classroom.

#### Implementing Gradient Descent
Mat will introduce you to a different error function and guide you through implementing gradient descent using NumPy matrix multiplication.

#### Training Neural Networks
By this lesson, you will know what neural networks are, be familiar with much of the underlying mathematics, and be able to construct basic networks in code. But your models won't always work wellâ€”so in this lesson, you will learn several techniques to optimize the training process.

#### Deep Learning with TensorFlow
In this lesson, we'll get a lot of hands-on practice and learn how to use TensorFlow to train a deep learning model that can classify images.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning
#### I. Clustering
Clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised approaches. In a first look at clustering, you will gain an understanding of what clustering your data means. Then, you will see how the k-means algorithm works. You will put your skills to work to find groupings of similar movies!

#### II. Hierarchical and Density Based Clustering
Another set of clustering algorithms takes an approach of using density based 'closeness' measures. At the end of the lesson, you will see how this can be used in traffic classification, as well as in anomaly detection (finding points that aren't like others in your dataset).

#### III. Gaussian Mixture Models and Cluster Validation
To extend the density based approaches, you will get some practice with gaussian mixture models. This technique is not far from what you learned in the previous lesson, and it is the last of the clustering algorithms you will learn before moving to matrix decomposition methods.

#### IV. Principal Component Analysis
Principal component analysis is one of the most popular decomposition methods available today. In this lesson, you will learn how matrix decomposition methods work conceptually. Then you will apply principal component analysis to images of handwritten digits to reduce the dimensionality of these images.

#### V. Random Projection and Independent Component Analysis
Another way to decompose data is through independent component analysis. In this lesson, you will see how this method can pull apart audio related to a piano, cello, and television that has been overlaid in the same file.
