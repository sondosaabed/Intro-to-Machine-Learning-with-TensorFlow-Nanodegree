# Intro-to-Machine-Learning-with-TensorFlow-Nanodegree
Acquired a full scholarship from Google Palestine Launchpad. It is about the mastery of machine learning techniques such as data transformation and algorithms that can find patterns in data and apply machine learning algorithms to tasks of their own design.

## Courses

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning


### 2. Introduction to neural networks
#### Introduction to Neural Networks
In this lesson, Luis will give you solid foundations on deep learning and neural networks. You'll also implement gradient descent and backpropagation in Python right here in the classroom.

#### Implementing Gradient Descent
Mat will introduce you to a different error function and guide you through implementing gradient descent using NumPy matrix multiplication.

#### Training Neural Networks
By this lesson, you will know what neural networks are, be familiar with much of the underlying mathematics, and be able to construct basic networks in code. But your models won't always work wellâ€”so in this lesson, you will learn several techniques to optimize the training process.

#### Deep Learning with TensorFlow
In this lesson, we'll get a lot of hands-on practice and learn how to use TensorFlow to train a deep learning model that can classify images.
